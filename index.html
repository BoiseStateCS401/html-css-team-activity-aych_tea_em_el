                <p>HTML is to sum it up functions as a kind of skeleton for the webpage. 
                    It contains the content and the structure and content of the page. 
                    HTML uses many opening and closing tags to put said content and information in the page.
                    HTML calls these tags elements and as as barebones as it seems does a good job at containing the information.
